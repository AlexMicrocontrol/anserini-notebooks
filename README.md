This repo holds static copies of Anserini notebooks.
There are two ways to play with the notebooks here, using Colab and Binder.

## Colab

The notebooks in this repo are sync'ed (by hand) with notebooks in Colab.
These online demos provide a low-effort way to try out Anserini and Pyserini features:

+ `anserini_robust04_demo.ipynb`: [Anserini Robust04 demo (Java)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1s44ylhEkXDzqNgkJSyXDYetGIxO9TWZn)
+ `pyserini_robust04_demo.ipynb`: [Pyserini Robust04 demo (Python interface to Anserini)](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wiDOnjsPMZzrleQF-GnE5W6VsF7biuXH)

Click "Open in Playground" and you'll be able to replicate our results!

## Binder

This entire repo is configured with work with [Binder](https://mybinder.org/).
Click the "launch binder" icon on the top-left corner to initialize an executable environment around these notebooks.

## Pre-Built Indexes

For convenience, we've pre-built a few common indexes, available to download [here](https://git.uwaterloo.ca/jimmylin/anserini-indexes).
