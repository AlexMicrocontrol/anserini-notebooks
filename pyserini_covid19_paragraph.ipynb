After incubation of the nsp1 protein with RRL at 4°C for 30 min, we added different concentrations of capped and polyadenylated Renilla luciferase mRNA transcripts (rLuc RNA) to the mixture, and incubated the samples in the presence of [ 35 S]methionine for 30 min. In control samples in which rLuc RNA was incubated with GST and nsp1-mt proteins, rLuc activity and labeled rLuc protein levels increased with rising mRNA concentrations. In contrast, the rLuc activity and labeled rLuc protein levels in the nsp1-containing sample was substantially lower than in the control samples; the rLuc activity and the radiolabeled rLuc protein levels in the presence of nsp1 were about 6-8% of the levels observed with GST or nsp1-mt ( Fig.  1a and b) , which clearly demonstrated that nsp1 efficiently inhibited the rLuc protein synthesis from capped rLuc RNA in RRL.']"

              " \"Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (SCoV), the causative agent of a newly emerged disease, SARS, is an enveloped virus that contains a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome of about 29.7 kb.1 Upon infection, the genome expression begins with the translation of gene 1, which constitutes the 5'-end two-thirds of the viral genome, to produce two large precursor polyproteins2,3 that are proteolytically processed by 2 virally encoded proteinases to generate 16 mature proteins, namely nsp1 to nsp162. While Users may view, print, copy, download and text and data-mine the content in such documents, for the purposes of academic research, subject always to the full Conditions of use: http://www.nature.com/authors/editorial_policies/license.html#terms most of these gene 1 proteins are essential for viral RNA synthesis, some of them appear to have other biological functions. [4] [5] [6] [7] The most N-terminal gene 1 protein, nsp1, has unique biological functions; expressed SCoV nsp1 induces host mRNA degradation and suppresses host translation8. The expressed nsp1 suppresses the host antiviral signaling pathways as well9. Furthermore, nsp1 suppresses host gene expression, including type I interferon (IFN) production, by promoting host mRNA degradation and host translation suppression in infected cells10. The nsp1 of a closely related mouse hepatitis virus also suppresses host gene expression and is a viral virulence factor11. These data suggest that the SCoV nsp1-mediated suppression of host genes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS. Accordingly, a delineation of the mechanisms of the nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression is considerably important for gaining insight into SCoV pathogenesis at the molecular level. We designed the present study to uncover the mechanism of nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression primarily by using an in vitro system. Our data revealed that nsp1 utilizes a novel, two-pronged strategy to inhibit host translation/gene expression.\"]"

Furthermore, the nsp1-40S ribosome complex induced the modification of the 5'-region of capped mRNA template and rendered the template RNA translationally incompetent. Nsp1 also induced RNA cleavage in templates carrying the internal ribosome entry site (IRES) from encephalomyocarditis virus, but not in those carrying IRESs from hepatitis C and cricket paralysis viruses, demonstrating that the nsp1-induced RNA modification was template-dependent.

[4] [5] [6] [7] The most N-terminal gene 1 protein, nsp1, has unique biological functions; expressed SCoV nsp1 induces host mRNA degradation and suppresses host translation8. The expressed nsp1 suppresses the host antiviral signaling pathways as well9. Furthermore, nsp1 suppresses host gene expression, including type I interferon (IFN) production, by promoting host mRNA degradation and host translation suppression in infected cells10. The nsp1 of a closely related mouse hepatitis virus also suppresses host gene expression and is a viral virulence factor11. These data suggest that the SCoV nsp1-mediated suppression of host genes plays an important role in the pathogenesis of SARS. Accordingly, a delineation of the mechanisms of the nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression is considerably important for gaining insight into SCoV pathogenesis at the molecular level. We designed the present study to uncover the mechanism of nsp1-induced suppression of host gene expression primarily by using an in vitro system. Our data revealed that nsp1 utilizes a novel, two-pronged strategy to inhibit host translation/gene expression.\",\n",

In control samples in which rLuc RNA was incubated with GST and nsp1-mt proteins, rLuc activity and labeled rLuc protein levels increased with rising mRNA concentrations. In contrast, the rLuc activity and labeled rLuc protein levels in the nsp1-containing sample was substantially lower than in the control samples; the rLuc activity and the radiolabeled rLuc protein levels in the presence of nsp1 were about 6-8% of the levels observed with GST or nsp1-mt ( Fig.  1a and b) , which clearly demonstrated that nsp1 efficiently inhibited the rLuc protein synthesis from capped rLuc RNA in RRL.\",\n",

We transfected 293 cells with mRNAs encoding nsp1, nsp1-mt or chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) proteins; all of these encoded proteins carried a C-terminal myc-His tag. At 8 h post transfection, we prepared the cell extracts and performed polysome profile analysis ( Fig. 2a-2c) . Expression of CAT and nsp1-mt showed similar polysome profiles, whereas nsp1 expression resulted in the accumulation of 80S monosomes, along with a significant reduction in the polysome abundance, in accordance with the observation that the expressed nsp1, but not nsp1-mt, suppresses host translation10. Western blot analysis of the resolved gradient fractions showed the co-sedimentation of the majority of nsp1, but not CAT and nsp1-mt, with the 40S ribosomal subunit (Fig. 2b) . Likewise, only nsp1 cosedimented with the 40S ribosomal subunit in RRL (Fig. 2d-2f) . To confirm the interaction of nsp1 with the 40S ribosomal subunit, we transfected 293 cells with in vitro-synthesized mRNAs encoding nsp1-myc-His fusion protein, CAT-myc-His protein or nsp1-mt-myc-His protein and subjected the cell extracts to immunoprecipitation with anti-myc antibody. The immune complexes were washed with 0.5 M KCl, a stringent high-salt condition in which the 60S ribosomal subunits and the translation initiation factors are dissociated from the 40S subunits14. Consistent with our previous report10, the expression level of nsp1 was substantially lower than that of nsp1-mt or CAT. Nevertheless, an efficient coimmunoprecipitation of 18S rRNA and S6 ribosomal protein, core components of the 40S subunit, with nsp1, but not with CAT and nsp1-mt ( Fig. 2g-2i) , suggested the tight association of nsp1 with the 40S ribosomal subunit. Similarly, co-immunoprecipitation analysis showed that nsp1 also interacted with the 40S ribosomal subunit in RRL ( Supplementary Fig. 1 ).\",\n",

To test the effect of nsp1 on 48S complex formation, in which the 43S complex binds to the mRNA, and 80S monosome assembly, we examined, by sucrose gradient fractionation, the levels of accumulation of these complexes on a radiolabeled mRNA template in the presence of nsp1. To analyze the effect of nsp1 on 80S formation, we incubated 32 P-labeled rLuc RNA template with nsp1, GST, or nsp1-mt in RRL in the presence of cycloheximide (CHX). CHX treatment inhibits the elongation step, but does not affect 80S monosome assembly15. We used hippuristanol, which blocks eIF4A function and inhibits 48S complex formation, as a control16. CHX treatment induced 80S complex accumulation and hippuristanol inhibited it (Fig. 3a) . Nsp1, but not GST and nsp1-mt, suppressed 80S complex formation (Fig. 3b) . We tested the effect of nsp1 on 48S complex formation by incubating the samples with GMP-PNP and subsequently, subjecting them to sucrose gradient centrifugation; GMP-PNP does not affect 48S complex formation, whereas it blocks GTP hydrolysis by eIF2 in eIF2-GTP-Met-tRNA complexes and inhibits the release of eIF2 and subsequent joining of the 60S ribosomal subunit17. The 48S complex accumulated in the presence of GMP-PNP, but not in the presence of hippuristanol (Fig. 3c) . Nsp1, nsp1-mt and GST did not suppress the 48S complex formation (Fig. 3d) .

After initial incubation of RRL with nsp1, GST or nsp1-mt in the presence of CHX or a mixture of CHX and GMP-PNP, we added the rLuc RNA that had been pre-annealed with a 5'-end labeled primer to the samples. Subsequently, we subjected the samples to primer extension experiments without extracting the RNAs. In control groups, using GST and nsp1-mt, we detected a correctly positioned toeprint (TP-AUG), which was a premature primer extension termination signal that was induced by the presence of the stalled 40S subunit. The toeprint was approximately 15-17 nt downstream from the translation initiation codon in the presence of GMP-PNP and CHX, which allow 48S complex formation, but not 60S joining (Fig. 4a , lanes 5 to 7). In the presence of CHX, the control groups showed an additional band approximately 3 nt downstream from TP-AUG, which was most probably generated by the joining of the 60S subunits with the 40S complex positioned at the AUG (Fig. 4a , asterisk, lanes 2 to 4). Consistent with the observation that nsp1 suppressed the 80S complex formation (Fig. 3b ), nsp1 caused a clear reduction in the amount of the toeprint for the 80S complex (Fig. 4a, lane 3) . Compared to the observations in the control groups, the abundance of the TP-AUG was also reduced in the sample containing nsp1 (Fig. 4a, lanes 3 and 6) , which suggested that nsp1 induced inefficient startcodon recognition. Unexpectedly, we detected several additional bands, both upstream and downstream of the TP-AUG, in the sample incubated with nsp1, but not in controls; a longer exposure of the CHX-treated sample clearly showed the same signals (data not shown). These data suggested that nsp1 induced the modification of rLuc RNA at several discrete sites, which blocked cDNA elongation on these modified RNAs.\",\n",

After incubation, we analyzed the extracted RNAs on a 5% sequencing gel. The amounts of the intact cap-labeled rLuc RNA, which had been incubated with nsp1, were clearly lower than that of the controls (Figs. 5a and 5b), demonstrating that the 5'-end region of the capped rLuc RNA was removed in the presence of nsp1. Incubation of the 3'-end-labeled rLuc RNA with nsp1 resulted in the appearance of an additional band that migrated slightly faster than the intact RNA (Fig. 5a , asterisk). The total radioactivity of the intact 3'-end labeled rLuc RNA and the fast-migrating RNA band in nsp1-treated samples was similar to that of the intact 3'-end labeled rLuc RNA in the controls (Fig. 5b) . To determine the approximate size of the fastmigrating band, we incubated 3'-end-labeled non-polyadenylated rLuc RNA with nsp1 in RRL; we used non-polyadenylated rLuc RNA because some of the polyadenylated rLuc RNA preparations had mRNA species with shorter poly(A) tails, which interfered with the positive identification of the truncated RNA products in the gel.

These data suggested that in addition to template RNA modification, the association of nsp1 with 40S ribosomal subunit also inactivated the translational function of 40S ribosomes. To further examine this possibility, we subjected Ren-CrPV-FF to in vitro translation in RRL in the presence of nsp1, GST or nsp1-mt. After incubation, we analyzed the aliquots of the samples by SDS-PAGE. As expected, nsp1, but not GST or nsp1-mt, suppressed both cap-dependent and IRES-dependent translation (Fig.  8a, 1 st ) . We added the same amount of the spike CAT RNA to the remaining samples, extracted RNAs and performed a second in vitro translation analysis without adding nsp1, GST or nsp1-mt (Fig. 8a, 2 nd , 8b) . The cap-dependent rLuc gene translation, from Ren-CrPV-FF RNA that was exposed to nsp1 in the first in vitro translation reaction, was inhibited but the IRES-mediated fLuc translation was not inhibited. Thus, nsp1 suppressed CrPV IRES-mediated translation in the first in vitro translation reaction but did not induce the modification that inactivated the translational activity of CrPV IRES in the second in vitro translation assay. Like rLuc RNA (Fig. 5) , incubation of cap-labeled Ren-CrPV-FF RNA with nsp1 resulted in the removal of the 5'-end region from this RNA (Fig. 8c) . We interpreted these results to suggest that binding of nsp1 to 40S ribosomal subunits inactivated the translational functions of 40S ribosomes leading to the inhibition of CrPV IRES-driven translation in Ren-CrPV-FF. Collectively, these data showed that nsp1 suppressed translation by inactivating the translational functions of 40S ribosomal subunits and modifying the template RNA.\",\n",

Vhs protein, which has a sequence similarity with known RNases, is indeed an RNase,28 induces RNA cleavage in RRL29, and degrades both host and viral mRNAs30. Unlike vhs, none of the known proteins share similarities with SCoV nsp1 in their sequence and structure. The biological activities of SCoV nsp1 also substantially differed from those of vhs, as nsp1 inactivated the translational functions of the 40S ribosomal subunit and modified RNA transcripts only in the context of its association with the 40S subunit. The strategy that SCoV nsp1 has evolved to bind to 40S subunits to exert its function appears to be an excellent one for blocking translation of both capped mRNAs and IRES-containing mRNAs, and for efficiently accessing host mRNAs, including those involved in host innate immune functions, and inactivating them.\",\n",

Using rLuc RNA as a template, we showed that the formation of the 80S complex, but not the 48S complex was inhibited in the presence of nsp1 (Fig. 3) . Because the nsp1-40S complex also modified the 5'-region of the rLuc RNA (Figs. 4 and 5) , it is possible that the nsp1-mediated RNA modification affected the formation of 48S and/or 80S complexes on these modified RNA templates (Fig. 3) . We obtained somewhat conflicting results, which showed that nsp1 did not suppress the 48S assembly on rLuc RNA (Fig. 3d) but the 48S TP-AUG signal was reduced in the presence of nsp1 (Fig. 4a) . These data may imply that some of the multiple toe-prints upstream of the TP-AUG, observed in nsp1-treated sample (Fig. 4a, lane 6) , represent arrested 48S translation intermediates as a result of nsp1 inactivating the function of 40S ribosomal subunit leading to inefficient start site recognition; these arrested 48S translation intermediates could contribute to the signal observed for 48S complex formation (Fig. 3d) . Furthermore, the nsp1-induced RNA modification alone cannot fully account for the substantially reduced luciferase protein synthesis from capped rLuc RNA (Fig. 1) , highlighting the contribution of the translation inhibition function of nsp1 towards the suppression of reporter protein expression in RRL. To clarify the exact step in the translation of capped mRNAs that nsp1 inhibits, it would be useful to isolate an nsp1 mutant that retains the 40S subunit inactivating function but lacks the RNA modification function, and test the effect of this mutant on 48S and 80S complex formations.\",\n",

Nsp1 induced a substantial reduction in the amount of full-length cap-labeled rLuc RNA (Fig. 5a) , which suggested a possibility that the very 5'-end of the rLuc RNA, including the 7methylguanosine cap and the radiolabeled phosphate group, was removed. Primer extension analysis of the rLuc RNA that had been incubated with nsp1 (Fig. 4b) revealed that nsp1 exerted the modification in several different regions at the 5'-end of rLuc RNA. An RNA signal that migrated slightly faster than the full-length rLuc RNA was detected after incubation of the 3'-end labeled rLuc RNA in the presence of nsp1 (Fig. 5a) . Analysis of the nsp1-treated non-polyadenylated rLuc RNA further showed that the fast migrating species of rLuc RNA shown in Fig. 5a consisted of at least two bands that were roughly 20 to 40 nt shorter than the full-length rLuc RNA template ( Supplementary Fig. 3 ). These data point to a possibility that the several premature primer extension termination products, which were obtained using nsp1-treated rLuc RNA (Fig. 4b) , were derived from rLuc RNA species lacking different regions from their 5'-ends. Because nsp1 induced an internal RNA cleavage in Ren-EMCV-FF RNA (Fig. 6) , we suspect that nsp1 also triggered a similar endonucleolytic RNA cleavage in the 5' region of rLuc RNA. We also noted that the amounts of the full-length primer extension product, obtained from rLuc RNA that had been incubated with nsp1, were not substantially different from the corresponding signal obtained from the control group (Fig. 4b) . These data imply that nsp1 induced the removal of the entire or a portion of the cap structure without affecting the first 5'-end nucleotide from the full-length rLuc RNA. Probably, the putative nsp1-induced endonucleolytic cleavage and decapping activities both contributed to the translational inactivation of nsp1-treated rLuc RNA.\",\n",

Because the translation initiation factors, eIF4G and eIF4A, are required for cap-dependent and EMCV IRES-mediated translation but not for translation driven by the IRESs of HCV and CrPV32, these factors may be involved in the induction of nsp1-mediated endonucleolytic RNA cleavage of template RNAs.

Another possibility is that binding of nsp1 to the 40S subunits induces the activation or recruitment of a host factor(s) that modifies the template RNAs. It is also possible that some ribosome-associated factors are involved in nsp1-induced RNA modification. In fact, host endonucleases can destabilize host mRNAs during translational elongation in polysomes33,34.
